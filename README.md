# RxMonitor
ReactiveX Async Stream Monitoring using Marble Diagrams. Idea is to create ad-hoc operators that send all the streams' activities to a monitor console that will show up such information using marble diagrams

The plan is to create such operators to monitor application based on :
1. [rxjs](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs)
2. [rxjava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjava) / [reactor](https://github.com/reactor)
